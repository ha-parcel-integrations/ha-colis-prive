> [!WARNING]
> **Pre-release.** Only a parcel delivered to the letterbox has been seen so far. Delivery in person or to a neighbour, pickup points, failed deliveries and returns have not, so such a parcel keeps showing its last recognised status until its message is mapped. If you see an "Unrecognised Colis Privé status" warning in your log, please [report it](https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-colis-prive/issues/new?template=unrecognised_status.yml).

A custom Home Assistant integration that tracks your [Colis Privé](https://www.colisprive.com/) parcels (France, Belgium and Luxembourg; often the last-mile courier for webshop orders). No account is needed: you enter the tracking code, and the postal code of the delivery address is set once per hub, just like on the Colis Privé tracking page.

Part of the [ha-parcel-integrations](https://ha-parcel-integrations.github.io/) family: it publishes the same canonical parcel format, statuses and events as the other carrier integrations, so it plugs straight into the [Parcel Aggregator](https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-parcel-aggregator) and cross-carrier automations.

## Features

- Track any number of Colis Privé parcels by tracking code — no account needed
- One hub per delivery postal code; set up as many as you need, across France, Belgium and Luxembourg
- Per-parcel sensor with the canonical status (`registered` / `in_transit` / `out_for_delivery` / …), the carrier's own status text in your Home Assistant language (French, Dutch or English) and a tracking deep-link
- Summary sensors: incoming parcels, recently delivered parcels
- Colis Privé publishes no delivery window, so the next-delivery sensor and the **Deliveries** calendar stay empty
- `colis_prive.track_parcel` / `colis_prive.untrack_parcel` services, so a dashboard button can add a parcel
- Events + device triggers for no-code automations (parcel registered, status changed, delivered, delivery time changed)
- Opt-in per-parcel status history
- Manual refresh button and a diagnostic last-update sensor

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.12 or newer
- A Colis Privé parcel, its tracking number (without the postal code) and the postal code
  of the delivery address (France 5 digits, Belgium or Luxembourg 4 digits) —
  no account needed

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. In HACS, choose the three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-colis-prive` as an **Integration**.
3. Install **Colis Privé** and restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/colis_prive` into your `config/custom_components/` folder and restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

Add the integration via **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Colis Privé**, then choose the country and the postal code of the address the parcels are delivered to. Nothing is contacted during setup.

A hub is one country and postal code. Add another hub for each other postal code (a second address, a relative's home); the same country and postal code cannot be added twice. Colis Privé looks a parcel up by its number and the delivery postal code together, so a parcel only shows up in the hub whose postal code it was sent to.

Then add parcels via the integration's **Configure** dialog, the [`colis_prive.track_parcel`](#services) service, or a [dashboard button](examples/dashboards/add_parcel_card.yaml). The tracking number is 12 letters or digits; enter it without the postal code. Spaces are ignored, so you can paste it as shown on the tracking page.

The status text follows your Home Assistant language: French, Dutch or English (any other language gets English). Changing the language changes `raw_status` on the next refresh and nothing else.

## Options

Open **Configure** on the integration entry:

| Section | Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parcels | Add / remove | — | Manage the tracked tracking codes. Changes apply immediately, no restart. |
| Delivered parcels | Filter by / amount | last 7 days | How long delivered parcels stay visible on the delivered sensor. |
| Parcel history | Include status history | off | Adds a `history` attribute per parcel with each status update. |

Polling isn't one of these settings: the integration polls on a dynamic,
status-driven schedule with nothing to configure.

## Dynamic polling

Polling isn't a setting here — the integration adjusts its own cadence to
what your tracked parcels are actually doing:

- **Quiet hours** — no polling between 00:00–06:00 local time, aside from one
  catch-up check at each end of that window (around midnight and around 6
  AM), so an overnight update is never missed.
- **Hot (every 15 minutes)** — while any tracked parcel is out for delivery
  today, starting an hour before its delivery window opens (or immediately if
  no window is known yet).
- **Normal (every 45 minutes)** — for anything else still on its way.
- **Fully paused** — once every tracked parcel has been delivered, or nothing
  is tracked at all, polling stops until you add a parcel back (adding one
  always triggers an immediate check, regardless of the pause).
- A small, fixed per-hub offset is added on top, so not every Colis Privé
  hub out there polls at exactly the same second.

Colis Privé gives no delivery window, so a parcel that is out for delivery is always polled on the hot schedule until it leaves that status.

## Removal

Standard HA removal applies: **Settings → Devices & Services → Colis Privé → ⋮ → Delete**. Nothing is stored on Colis Privé's side.

## Sensors

| Entity | Description |
|---|---|
| `sensor.colis_prive_<postal code>_incoming_parcels` | Number of active tracked parcels, full list under the `parcels` attribute |
| `sensor.colis_prive_<postal code>_parcel_<code>` | One per tracked parcel; state is the canonical status, attributes carry the full normalised parcel |
| `sensor.colis_prive_<postal code>_next_delivery` | Stays empty: Colis Privé publishes no delivery window |
| `sensor.colis_prive_<postal code>_delivered_parcels` | Recently delivered parcels (see the retention option) |
| `sensor.colis_prive_<postal code>_last_successful_update` | Diagnostic: when Colis Privé was last polled successfully |

Each hub has its own set of sensors, named after the hub. A delivered parcel moves from its per-parcel sensor to the delivered sensor automatically once Colis Privé's delivered message is recognised.

## Parcel status reference

The `status` field is the carrier-agnostic enum shared by the whole integration family:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `registered` | The sender is preparing the parcel; it will be handed to Colis Privé soon |
| `in_transit` | Taken over by Colis Privé, or at the regional distribution office |
| `out_for_delivery` | With the courier today |
| `delivered` | Delivered to the letterbox |
| `unknown` | Not found yet (see Troubleshooting), or a message that is not recognised yet |

`at_pickup_point`, `returning` and `problem` exist in the shared format but are not produced yet: those Colis Privé messages have not been observed, and neither has delivery in person or to a neighbour. They are added to the map as soon as they are seen.

The carrier's own human-readable text is always available as `raw_status`.

## Events

The integration fires these on the event bus (also available as device triggers on the Colis Privé device):

| Event | When |
|---|---|
| `colis_prive_parcel_registered` | A new parcel appears in the active list |
| `colis_prive_parcel_status_changed` | A parcel's canonical status changes (`old_status` / `new_status` in the payload), except the final hop to delivered |
| `colis_prive_parcel_delivered` | A parcel is delivered |
| `colis_prive_parcel_delivery_time_changed` | Never fires: Colis Privé publishes no delivery window |

Every payload is the full normalised parcel plus the hub's `device_id`. Events are suppressed on the first refresh after start-up.

## Services

| Service | Fields | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `colis_prive.track_parcel` | `tracking_code`, `country`, `postal_code` | Start tracking a parcel. `country` and `postal_code` choose the hub; leave them out with one hub, and give both with several (Belgium and Luxembourg share four-digit postal codes). |
| `colis_prive.untrack_parcel` | `tracking_code`, `country`, `postal_code` | Stop tracking a parcel. The hub is found from the code; give `country` and `postal_code` only if the same code is tracked in more than one hub. |

## Examples

Ready-to-paste automations and dashboard snippets live in [`examples/`](examples/), including tracking a new parcel straight from a dashboard.

### Community Lovelace cards

Third-party cards that work with this integration's sensors:

## Debugging

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.colis_prive: debug
```

## Troubleshooting

- **A parcel shows `unknown`** — Colis Privé answers the same way for a number it has not received yet, a wrong number and a wrong postal code, so these cannot be told apart. A merchant often prints the label days before the first scan; the parcel picks up automatically once Colis Privé has it. Check that the hub's postal code is the delivery address's, and that the number was entered without the postal code attached.
- **A parcel looks stuck** — only the letterbox delivery message is known so far; delivery in person or to a neighbour, pickup-point, failed-delivery and return messages have not been observed yet. An unrecognised message keeps the last recognised status and logs a warning.
- **A status logs "Unrecognised Colis Privé status"** — please [open an issue](https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-colis-prive/issues/new?template=unrecognised_status.yml) with the logged line (it names the language) so the mapping can be extended.
- **Updates fail after working before** — if Colis Privé changes its tracking page, the integration stops updating and keeps the last data instead of guessing. Open an issue.
